# Shell Hacks 2018

## We are on a mission to remove emissions

### Tech stack: Python, Azure, Wix, Javascript

### What it does
GreenGrocer helps users reduce their negative environmental impacts by analyzing their receipts and making them aware of the ecological impact of their groceries.

### How we built it
The GreenGrocer website is hosted on Wix which communicates with our backend and Azure via REST endpoints. After a user uploads a photo of their receipt, GreenGrocer utilizes Azure's Computer Vision service to perform image to text analysis of receipts. This text is then matched to a database to look for high impact keywords. Information is retrieved and displayed to the user to help them make more informed decisions based on their purchases.


### What's next for GreenGrocer
* Expand database of suggestions and facts to include more products
* Integrate location services to find best produce based on area
* Create rewards system to support eco friendly purchases
